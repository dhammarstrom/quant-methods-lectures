## Basics: Quarto and Rmarkdown

::: {.incremental}

- Quarto and R Markdown a special kind of scripts where text and computer code can be combined to generate reports. 
- Under the hood, a report generator is converting code and plain text to an output format such as *html*, *pdf* or *docx* (more formats are available).
- Quarto is a new, [well documented](https://quarto.org/) format that gives extra flexibility, but also requires installation of extra software.
- R Markdown is even more well documented, see e.g. [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [R Markdown: The Definitev Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
